##How to create and clone a GitHub repository
  1. A Git repository is a group of files that are stored on your local computer and on GitHub
  2. To create a repository, go to the repository tab on your GitHub profile page and click the "New" button
  3. This will bring you to the set up page for your new repository
  4. You will need to fill in a repository name. It can't have any spaces, but you can special characters (preferably dashes) to separate words and make the name easier to read.
  5. There are options for making your repository public or private, to initialize the repository with a README file, to add a .gitgnore file, and add a license. For the purposes of this tutorial leave these as they are except for the license. Choose the MIT license and then click "Create Repository."
  6. You've created a GitHub repository!
  7. On the repository page that you are taken to, copy the repository web address which starts with "https://github.com/..."
  8. Next, to clone the repository, you will need to open up the terminal on your computer. If you don't know how to do that, open up your applications folder and search for "terminal." Use the option to search only file names and you should find the application.
  9. Open the terminal program and create a new directory to clone your repository to. The command to do this is the command is "mkdir [NAME-OF-DIRECTORY]" (replace [NAME-OF-DIRECTORY] with the name you want to give to this directory).
  10. Now you can clone the repository into this new directory by using this command "git clone [REPOSITORY-URL]" (replace [REPOSITORY-URL] with the web address you copied on GitHub)
  11. Type the command "ls" and you will be shown a list of files and directories in your current location. You should see the name you gave to the repository on GitHub among them.
  12. To access the repository type "cd [NAME-OF-REPOSITORY]"
  13. You've now created a repository and cloned it to your computer!

##What does Open Source mean?
When a developer openly shares the source code for their software and allows other to alter the code as they see fit, it is call Open Source or Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).

##What do I think of Open Source?
I love the concept of Open Source software. It is wonderful for the consumer on a number of levels. It provides free or low cost options to consumers who don't have the income to afford expensive software like Photoshop, MS Office, etc. It also drives competition in the industry and pushes major software publishers to put out a better product. While I understand the need for businesses to keep work proprietary, more companies (e.g. Google, Tesla) are now proving that going open source can be beneficial as a business practice as well.

##Assess the importance of using licenses
Clearly it is important to research and decide on a license that fits your needs. It appears that the main thing to consider is want an extremely permissive license that allows others to do anything they want with your code as long as they attribute your contributions or if you want to ensure that any derivative work must also be freely shared as open source work.

##What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This was probably the easiest challenge for me so far. I struggled quite a bit with module 1.5, but I also got a lot of practice because of it and found that the git commands and processes came pretty easy to me here. I think writing the guide to creating and cloning a GitHub repository to be the most difficult aspect for me. I used to write instructions for some processes at work for non-tech people, but they were also people that didn't really care to gain a greater understanding of the process. They just wanted the steps necessary to get it done. So trying to provide that detail, but also include some information to give the user greater understanding of what is going on was somewhat challenging.

##Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic?
For licensing information I found the GitHub produced website, (http://www.choosealicense.com), to be a valuable resource.
