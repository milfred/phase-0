          Benefits of Version Control Version is extremely helpful for developrs. It allows developrs to easily revert back to previous versions of code. By doing this developrs are able to more easily find bugs or fix issues or mistakes that may take place along the way. It works almost like a snapshot in time!

          Git helps developrs keep track of these changes. It offers the ability to insert comments on what exactly was changed of modified so developrs can easily see what, why, and how things were changed.

          Github is useful for two big reasons. First it is a remote location for code and files to be saved/stored. This is tremendously helpful because you never know when your local system may fail. By having your code stored remotely it is helps revent the loss of important code and serves as a backup. The second reason Github is helpful is that it enables multiple developrs and users to be able to access, modify/edit, and work on the same code. Through Github, you can see who made modifications, when, how and why! When used correctly Github can be a very powerful tool for developrs.

          <h2>Why a Version Control System is Essential to Modern Software Development</h2>

          I've only been a budding developer for a little less than a week now, but one thing I can say for certain is that version control and GitHub will be an important part of my life as I progress as a programmer. A version control system (VCS) is a way to track changes to software and a means for developers to work on the same project simultaneously, while avoiding conflicts or overwriting each other's code.
          </p>
          <h4>The key benefits to using a VCS are:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Orginization. Every time a set of changes is commited, it is logged and a version of the repository is saved. Team members can see the entire history of changes to the project and view messages regarding what changes were made and when. It also eliminates the need to manage, save, and name mutiple versions of your files on your own.</li>
            <li>
            Teamwork. With a VCS, every member of the team working on a project can work without restrictions or fear of overwriting a file someone else is working on because every memeber has a full version or the repository on their computer. Adding messages to each commit helps your teammates know what work has been done.</li>
            <li>
            Security. Because a version of the repository is saved after each commit, the project can be rolled back to an earlier version if something goes wrong. There's no need to worry about hardware failure, accidental damage, or inadvertant overwriting of data when you use a VCS. All you need to do to recover what you lost is pull the repository from one of your contributors. With services like GitHub, you can also store a master version of the repository in the cloud, further protecting your data.</li>
            <li>
            Git is a an Open Source VCS that helps keep track of the file changes for a project. It's basically a filing system that saves a version of every draft of file. It does this by viewing all files in three ways. Modified/Untracked, Staged, and Committed. While you are working on a file, it is in the modified state. Once you are done changing it, you can add it to the staging area to be committed once you've finished modifing all the files you want for that change/commit. Once you commit those files in the staging area, you have essentially created a new snapshot or save point of your repository that you can refer back to or completely roll back your project to.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
          GitHub is one part cloud storage for you git repositories and one part social network for developers. It hosts a central repository for your project that can be pulled down to your local machine for you to work on. Then you push the modified repository back up to the central repo when you're done. All of the contributors to a project can view each version change and what was updated. As stated above, having a central repository hosted on GitHub adds an extra measure of protection against accidental data loss.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
<main>, <article>, and <section>. With HTML5, these tags have essentially replaced the <div> tag as the basic building blocks of an html page making them tags that will likely be used on nearly every page on the web someday.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements on an html page get laid out based on their position in the code from the top to the bottom. A box-level element will take up the entire width of the page. Inline-level elements only occupy the width needed to display their content. If an element is displayed as inline-block, it will allow other elements to sit on the same level on the page, but can still have it's own width even if it doesn't contain content. A browser displays conent in the order that it's encountered on the page from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
We learned how to create and use a snippet. I will definitely be researching more about snippets and creating more. Any tool that can speed up the development process is worth looking into.
