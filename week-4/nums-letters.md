#Chapter 1 Summary

**What does puts do?**
"puts" prints the output of the program to the console with a new line.

**What is an integer? What is a float?**
An integer is a whole number value like 1 or 10 with no decimal points. A float is a number with decimal points. Floats aren't typically used in programming.

**What is the difference between a float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**
If you divide two integers the output will always be a whole number rounded down. For example, 5 / 2 would result in a value of 2. When you divide a float you will get a mathmatically correct output. For example, if you divide 5.0 / 2.0 the result will be a value of 2.5.
