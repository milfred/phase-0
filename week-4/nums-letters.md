#4.2 Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment


##Release 1: Summarize

**What does puts do?**
"puts" prints the output of the program to the console with a new line.

**What is an integer? What is a float?**
An integer is a whole number value like 1 or 10 with no decimal points. A float is a number with decimal points. Floats aren't typically used in programming.

**What is the difference between a float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**
If you divide two integers the output will always be a whole number rounded down. For example, 5 / 2 would result in a value of 2. When you divide a float you will get a mathmatically correct output. For example, if you divide 5.0 / 2.0 the result will be a value of 2.5.

##Release 2: Try it!

**How many hours in a year program**
```
puts 24 * 365
```

**How many minutes in a decade** (not including leap years)
```
puts ((24 * 60) * 365) * 10
```

##Release 7: Reflect
**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**
Numbers can either be integers or floats. An integer is always a whole number. A float is a number that has decimal points. You can add numbers using _+_, subtract using _-_, divide using _/_, multiply using _*_, and find the remainder of two numbers after division using the modulu operator _%_.

**What is the difference between integers and floats?**
Numbers can either be integers or floats. An integer is always a whole number. Any mathmatical operation using integers will always output a whole number. A float is a number that has decimal points.

**What is the difference between integer and float division?**
If you divide two integers the output will be rounded down to the nearest whole number. When floats are divided the output will be a mathmatically accurate number with decimal places.

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**
A string is a group of letters. You would use strings when you want to print or output text in your program.

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**
Variables allow you to assign a name to an object like a string and then reuse that object in your code using the assigned name. Variables save time when your programming because you don't have to write out a string every time you want to use it. It also keeps your code cleaner.

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**
It was a good review. I was overthinking some of the excercises and that slowed me down, but ultimately I got everything working and realized the solution was actually pretty
