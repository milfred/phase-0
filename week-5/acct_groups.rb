# Input: An array of cohort member names
# Output: An array with values that are hashes containing members of each accountability group. Accountability group numbers wil. be the key and member names will be the value
# Write a method that takes two arguments for the creation of a hash.
# Initialize a hash
# Check to see of array length has a remainder of 3 or more when divided by 5
# If it is, use the each_slice method with a value of 5 to separate it into a hash
# If not, check to see if the array legth has a remainder of 3 or more when divided by 4
#
# If it is, use the split_each method with a value of 4 to separate it into a hash
# Return the array with hashes

# Reflection
# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
# I really had no idea how many steps I was going to need when I wrote the pseudocode. I think the hardest part and also the most interesting was figuring out how I could account for any size list of names to divide into groups that were no less than three and no more than five.

# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
# I don't think I really got it quite right this time, but in general it's improving.

# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
# My approach was to use an if statement to work through the best scenerios (a number of students that are divisible by 4 or 5), down to the least ideal scenerio. Groups of three with a remainder of one or two that would be tacked on to the last group.

# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
# I decided to store them in a hash, so I could assign a key for each group and store the names in a array as the value.

# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
# I spent a lot of time just getting my initial solution to work. I didn't find a solution that would significantly simplify my initial solution. I did, however, change my initial solution to shuffle the list of names at the beginning of the method, so you get a random result rather than just dividing the original input as it is.
