Reflection for 2.6 First HTML Page
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I have had some experience with HTML before, so there wasn't a lot of new information in the material. However, I always enjoy the process of taking content and turning it into a structured html page.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Great! I really enjoyed the process of trying to keep the html as semantic as possible.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I believe I've done well so far, but we'll see how it all works out when it comes to adding CSS next week.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I think HTML is an effective and logical way of displaying information on the web. It has changed over the years to some degree in an attempt to keep up with how the web is used, but as dated as Berkshire Hathaway's website seems, it still delivers the information needed in a simple and readable way. The worst thing about HTML isn't necessarily a flaw in the language itself. Browser and device compatibility make it difficult to ensure that your work looks good no matter how a user accesses it. There are solutions to that (e.g. responsive design, mobile apps, separate mobile websites, etc.), but none of them are perfect.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I don't really have any tricks exactly. I think you just have to practice a lot and try to keep the code as logical and simple as possible.
