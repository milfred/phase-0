<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
Both of us had prior html experience, but it is always helpful to build a website from the ground up.  It was a fairly straightforward exercise for us.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
This site didn't require a lot of HTML5, however we played around with the footer tag, which we had learned through our research is new with HTML5.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We went into the exercise knowing that we will style the page in CSS next week, so we didn't worry too much about formatting.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
We feel that HTML is good because it is fairly easy to learn, however there is only so much you can do with design and functionality of HTML.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
We have memorized a lot of the html tags used in this exercise, but the names are also pretty easy to remember (p tag for paragraph, etc.)
